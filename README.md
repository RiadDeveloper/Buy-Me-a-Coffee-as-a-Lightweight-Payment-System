---

## 🧭 Introduction

This documentation will walk you through how to use **Buy Me a Coffee (BMC)** not just as a donation platform, but as a simple, elegant **payment gateway alternative** for selling **multiple digital products** through your own website.

You’ll learn how to:

* Set up digital products on BMC
* Connect purchases to your own site
* Track purchases via email & product
* Handle **multiple purchases** per user
* Deliver products automatically
* Build a user dashboard for purchase history

This guide is ideal for indie creators, digital sellers, or developers who want a **low-code, cost-effective** setup without integrating full-scale payment processors.

## 🛠️ Part 1: Setting Up Products in Buy Me a Coffee

### 🎯 Step 1: Create Your Product in BMC

1. Log in to your [Buy Me a Coffee Dashboard](https://buymeacoffee.com).
2. Go to **Extras** or **Shop**.
3. For each digital product:

   * Add a **Title**, **Price**, and **Short Description**.
   * Use the **Note to Seller** or **Label** to include a unique product tag. Example: `product_id=template01`
   * Set a **Redirect URL** (e.g. `https://yourwebsite.com/thank-you?ref=template01`).

💡 Pro Tip: Keep `product_id` consistent in both BMC and your database so you can map purchases easily.

### 🔗 Step 2: Embed Purchase Links on Your Site

Add a “Buy Now” button for each product:

```html
<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/yourusername/e/product-id" class="buy-button">Buy Premium Template</a>
```

You can also style these buttons or use embedded widgets.

## 📩 Part 2: Collecting and Verifying Payments

### ✅ Preferred Method: Use BMC Webhooks

**Why Webhooks?** They notify your server when a payment is made so you can:

* Instantly record orders
* Auto-send download links
* Track multiple orders from the same email

#### 🔌 Step-by-Step Webhook Integration

1. Upgrade to a BMC plan that supports webhooks.
2. Go to `Dashboard > Settings > Webhooks`
3. Add your webhook URL: `https://yourwebsite.com/api/bmc-webhook`

#### 🧾 Sample Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "type": "support",
  "data": {
    "payer_email": "jane@example.com",
    "note": "product_id=template01",
    "amount": 10,
    "supporter_name": "Jane Doe"
  }
}
```

#### 📥 Backend Handler Example (Node.js)

```js
app.post('/api/bmc-webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { payer_email, note } = req.body.data;
  const productId = note.split('=')[1];

  // Save to DB
  savePurchase(payer_email, productId);

  // Send download email
  sendDownloadLink(payer_email, productId);

  res.status(200).send('Received');
});
```

## 📦 Part 3: Supporting Multiple Product Purchases per User

BMC does not offer a shopping cart. Each product is purchased individually.

To handle users buying **more than one product**:

### 🧱 Step 1: Set Up Your Orders Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  product_id VARCHAR(100),
  purchase_date DATETIME
);
```

### ➕ Step 2: Save Every Purchase

When you receive a webhook, create a new row in the `orders` table. This lets users buy many different items, even with the same email address.

### 🗂️ Example Order History:

| email                                       | product\_id | purchase\_date      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com) | template01  | 2025-05-01 14:00:00 |
| [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com) | iconpack01  | 2025-05-03 16:20:00 |

## 📤 Part 4: Delivering Digital Products Automatically

When a purchase is confirmed:

1. Parse the product ID
2. Fetch download link or license
3. Email the product (or unlock via dashboard)

### 📧 Email Template Example:

```text
Subject: Your Product is Ready!

Hi Jane,

Thanks for your purchase! You can download your product below:

👉 Download Template: https://yourwebsite.com/downloads/template01.zip

Enjoy!
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Part 5: Creating a User Dashboard

Let users view and access all their past purchases:

### 🧪 Step 1: Create `/my-purchases` page

* Input field for email
* POST to backend to query their orders

### 🔍 Step 2: Fetch from Database

```sql
SELECT product_id, purchase_date FROM orders WHERE email = 'jane@example.com';
```

### 💡 Optional Enhancements:

* Show product name, thumbnail, and download buttons
* Save email in session for returning visits

---

## 🔁 Part 6: Fallback Option Without Webhooks

If you can’t use webhooks:

1. Redirect users to a shared `thank-you` page
2. Ask for their email on that page
3. Periodically check BMC’s supporter history for matches

Not ideal, but usable for low volume.

---

## 💡 Design Tips for Better UX

* Add product tags in BMC’s message field like `product_id=xxx`
* Include order confirmation on-site (with timer)
* Use simple, mobile-friendly forms
* Always show purchase history and support email

## ⚠️ Limitations of BMC as a Gateway

| Limitation               | Notes                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| No API checkout sessions | You can't initiate payments programmatically |
| No cart                  | One product = one payment                    |
| No refund automation     | Must handle refunds manually                 |
| Webhooks = paid feature  | Requires a Supporter+ plan or above          |

## 🚀 When to Consider Upgrading

If you need:

* License keys
* Cart support

Look into: Stripe Checkout, Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, or Payhip.
